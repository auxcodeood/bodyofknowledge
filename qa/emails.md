# E-Mails

## Rule

QA must be done _only_ w/ personaly identifiable company e-mails. Fantasy emails (such as test@test.com or alasdjfdsalfjadsl@adfafsdafs.com) are _strictly and absolutely forbidden_. As long as we are using Google Workspace, one can create a unlimited number of emails by adding a "+" sign after the part of the email before the "@" symbol.

For example t.e.shaw+1@auxnederlandbv.nl will deliver to t.e.shaw@auxnederlandbv.nl. You can create a unlimited number of unique emails per project by typing name+PROJECTSLUGYYMMDDHHSS@TLD.
