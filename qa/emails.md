# E-Mails

## Rule

QA must be done _only_ w/ personal company e-mails. Fantasy emails are _forbidden_. As long as we are using Google Workspace, one can create a unlimited number of emails by adding a "+" sign after the part of the email before the "@" symbol.

For example t.e.shaw+1@auxnederlandbv.nl will deliver to t.e.shaw@auxnederlandbv.nl. You can create a unlimited number of unique emails per project by typing name+PROJECTSLUGYYMMDDHHSS@TLD.
